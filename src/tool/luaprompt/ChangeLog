	* Released version 0.3.1 with the following changes:
	  - Fixed numerous memory leaks as well as a minor off-by-one
	    bug in the file name completion generator.  Sources now
	    hold up to scrutiny by Valgrind.
	  - Removed the use of wordexp() to expand the path to the
	    history file.  Its use probably caused more problems than
	    it solved due to its unavailability on some platforms.
